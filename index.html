                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                I work with data to understand problems, improve processes, and support better decisions. My background combines hands-on experience with data quality, annotation workflows, and analysis, which has given me a strong foundation in how real-world data is created, cleaned, and used. <br>
                I started getting into data science around 2020. My background is in Physics, so I was already comfortable with math, statistics, and logical problem-solving. I’d also worked a bit with C, C++, and MATLAB, which made it easier to pick up data-related programming later on.<br>
                What really pulled me in was AI especially computer vision and deep learning. I was curious about how models actually learn from data and how those ideas turn into real systems. At first, I learned in a very unstructured way: videos, articles, experiments, trying things out and breaking them. Over time, I realized I needed more direction, so I took structured courses and completed the IBM Data Science and IBM Data Analyst certifications. Those helped me turn curiosity into practical skills with Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and machine learning.<br>
                Since then, I’ve focused on learning by doing, working with real datasets, cleaning messy data, building dashboards, and experimenting with models to understand what actually works and why. I enjoy the process of turning raw data into something useful and understandable.<br>
                I’m still learning, still experimenting, and deliberately growing toward more advanced data science work. For me, this field isn’t just a career choice, it’s where curiosity, structure, and real-world problem-solving come together.
